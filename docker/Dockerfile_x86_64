# -*- mode: Dockerfile -*-

# This Dockerfile may be used to create an Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64 image, configured for Swift
# development and with our new Libpl library, that offers an attempt to emulate small parts
# of Apple's os.activity library, which is required by opentelemetry-swift.
#
# From this file's home directory, run: docker build -f Dockerfile_x86_64 -t swift-build_x86_64.

# This --force-architecture flag is needed here because, of course, MacOS uses a different
# virtualization method with docker containers. Apple just HAS to be different...
