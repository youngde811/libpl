# This Dockerfile may be used to create an Ubuntu 22.04 arm64 image, configured for Swift
# development and with our new Libpl library, that offers an attempt to emulate small parts
# of Apple's os.activity library, which is required by opentelemetry-swift.
#
# From this file's home directory, run: docker build -f Dockerfile_arm64 -t swift-build_arm64.
