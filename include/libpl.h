 * supplies the actual return address of the calling function (and its parent). By default,
 * variant one (fetching the calling function's frame) seems to be the most reliable on
 * arm64 and x86_64.
 *
 * NB: On some machines it may be impossible to determine the return address of any function
 * other than the current one; in such cases, the parent value will be set to zero (0).
