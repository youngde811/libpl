/*
 * This library is used to create an "activity context" that attempts to mimic the Apple
 * os.activity library's os_activity_get_identifier() function. In reality, there is no
 * analog to Apple's library for Linux; rather, we're left with trying to create a stack-local
 * unique ID, which is very platform-dependent.
 *
 * NB: The technique employed by this library is not portable, or even reliable on certain machines.
 * It uses gcc builtin functions to retrieve the current and parent stack frame addresses, documented
 * here: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Return-Address.html.
 * How successful we can be depends much on the platform architecture. On ARM64 we get good values.
 * It remains to be seen what other architectures, such as AMD64, give us.
